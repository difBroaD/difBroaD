# 👋 Hi, I’m @difBroaD

- 👀 I’m a Dutch student studying Electrical Engineering, and I’m interested in:
  - Analog technology
  - Power electronics
  - Digital technology (VHDL)
  - Embedded systems

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - VHDL
  - Mobile application development
  - Embedded-controlled digital timers

### Projects I'm Working On:
- **VHDL Projects**: 
  - Alarm clock (Wekker)
  - Elevator control (Liftbesturing)
  - Reaction tester (Reactietester)
  - PID Controller using a PLD MAX II
- **Mobile Application**: Developing an application for measuring ground values for a client (DBE).
- **Embedded-Controlled Digital Timer**: Using a PSoC5LP as a microcontroller.
- **Discrete Op-Amp Project**: Calculated, simulated using LT-Spice, built a discrete op-amp in real life (designed PCB) and performed measurements such as Bode plots and temperature dependence.
- **PHP Application**: Developing a PHP application.


- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and building practical applications.
